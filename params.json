{"name":"Learnjava","tagline":"Learn Java Programming","body":"# LearnJava \r\n\r\nThis repository contains code samples and exercises to support the **Learn to Program in Java** video series.\r\n\r\n[Here's a link to the series on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyRiRUsTyUXhUXoOPEdMZWhGpGeSQFZgH)\r\n\r\nThere are 20 lessons total, each in a separate folder.\r\n\r\nEach lesson folder contains:\r\n- The source code which was written during the video lesson, so you can run the examples on your own.\r\n- Code exercises, so you can practice programming and debugging code, specifically:\r\n  - One **DebugThis!** exercise where you fix problems with a broken program.\r\n  - Two **Challenge Activities** where you write a portion of code to complete a larger program. \r\n- The solutions to the code exercises, in case you get stuck and need to peek at the answers.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you and enjoy!\r\n\r\nMichael","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
