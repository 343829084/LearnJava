/*
 * Challenge Acticity II - A Hand of Cards
 * 
 * In this acticity we will implement a class to satisfy a hand of cards
 * (which is simply a collection of cards you are delt)
 * 
 * While it would be nice to use the actual deck.java class it makes more sense 
 * to manually issue cards to our hand for testing purposes. ;-)
 * 
 * In Hand.java you'll implement the following methods.
 *  - count(suit)
 *  - count(rank)
 *  - Pair() - returns the rank of the highest pair or Ranks.NONE
 *  - Three of a kind
 *  - Full House
 * 
 * I wrote unit tests for these methods. You can use these tests to prove you've
 * completed the methods correctly by getting the tests to pass.
 * 
 *  PRESS: CTRL + F6 to execute the tests.
 * 
 * 
 * PROGRAM OUTPUT:
 *
